# from the graph, we can see Golden state warriors have the highest PC1. No wonder they're the champion.

# Was this your first time working on a project with such file structure? If yes, how do
#you feel about it?
# no
# Was this your first time using relative paths? If yes, can you tell why they are important
#for reproducibility purposes?
# no, I'm cs major.
# because when sharing code with others, it can fit their laptop path
# Was this your first time using an R script? If yes, what do you think about just writing
#code? # no
# What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?
# PCA is hard
# What was easy(-ish) even though we havenâ€™t done it in class/lab?
# all hard
# Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?
# no
# How much time did it take to complete this HW?
# 4 hours
# What was the most time consuming part?
# PCA 

# Was there anything interesting?
# no
