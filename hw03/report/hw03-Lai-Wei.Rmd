# from the graph, we can see Golden state warriors have the highest PC1. No wonder they're the champion.

```{r}
#Was this your first time working on a project with such file structure? If yes, how do you feel about it?
# Yes.

#Was this your first time using relative paths? If yes, can you tell why they are important for reproducibility purposes?
# No.we used relative path in exams as well.

#Was this your first time using  R script? If yes, what do you think about just writing code?
# No.

#What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?
# I have no idea about PCA

#Was was easy?
 # merging is easy
```
