#                                      Simple&Fast Web Data Tool: Shiny

### Intro
    Shiny App is a powerful tool to create web app for data engineers & scientists. It makes web visualization and interaction become very easy for data engineers. In the past, I really cannot tell the difference between R and python in their data processing ability. But after experiecing with shiny, I have to say R has a better visualization ability for its customers. I have been a web programmers for quite a long time, and I know how time-consuming it is to make website. If a data scienists has to spend a lot of time on web creation, it's going to lower their data analysis quality. In this Post, I'll make a compaarsion between normal web development process and R web process and demonstrate some of Shiny's advantages.
